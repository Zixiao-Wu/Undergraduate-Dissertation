# Undergraduate-Dissertation
This is a dissertation project focused on corporate finance analysis and modeling.

## Topics
This research takes the financial indicators of Chinese listed companies as the research samples, selects the financial data from 2015-2020, draws on the existing theoretical models and research experience, introduces financial variables and non-financial variables, and establishes a logistic regression model for predicting the financial risk of listed companies, and applies the Propensity Score Matching method to improve it. 
Through the analysis of the model, it can be found that: 

(1) The variable data of year T-1 contains the most information about the financial situation of the company, and the modeling effect is best by using it; 

(2) The financial indicators constructed in terms of cash flow, operating capacity, solvency, profitability, and growth capacity have excellent predictability in the model; 

(3) The non-financial indicator variables play a specific role in the prediction of the model; (4) the propensity score matching method is used to predict the financial risk of the sample companies;

(4) Using the propensity score matching method to match samples 1:1 can improve;

Since Stata was used in analysis and hard to code, Python version will come later
